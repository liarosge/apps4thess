MobilitySense

Mobility Sense is a prototype application that has been developed in the context of the EU-funded project Live+Gov (http://liveandgov.eu) with the aim to exploit the capabilities of modern smartphones in order to, on the one hand, offer the citizen personalized information about smart ways for commuting during the rush hour, and, on the other hand, turn the citizen into a living sensor of the traffic status of his city.

More specifically, the MobilitySense application offers the following functionalities:
- Uses a map-based interface to inform citizens in real-time about the tram lines that deviate from the scheduled time-plan.
- Offers a personalized view of the city’s traffic situation that includes only the tram lines that are estimated as relevant to the citizen based on his current position.
- Offers the possibility to receive notifications generated from the city’s official regional transport office, about important problems in the city’s traffic network (e.g. Tram line 4 out of service from 15:00 – 17:00 due to maintenance).
- Offers the possibility for the citizens to share written messages (including a photo and GPS coordinates) about unexpected incidents that are likely to influence the good service of the city’s traffic network (e.g. Tram Line 8 delayed due to a car accident) in order to timely inform fellow citizens within the area 
- Offers a mechanism for the recording of the daily citizen’s routes when commuting in the city and for (optionally) submitting these routes to the city’s regional transport office in order to contribute in optimizing the city’s traffic network.
- Incorporates Augmented Reality for visualizing the nearby bus stops in an augmented manner and presenting timetable information about the bus lines crossing this stop.



-Depends on metaioSDK(http://www.metaio.com/SDK/) and SensorCollector(https://github.com/HeinrichHartmann/LiveGovWP1)
